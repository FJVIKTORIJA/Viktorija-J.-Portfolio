# Personal Porfolio

## Description

This portfolio has been created to present personal current and upcoming skills to highlight the work, skills and potential while learning in bootcamp. Since my background experience is not related with coding or computing science I have found that this way to showcase personal potential is far more effective rather than a simple resume. 

While creating my personal portfolio I was able to apply and learn more about functionallity and application of HTML and CSS importance and practice to create a real web page and identify personal mistakes.
